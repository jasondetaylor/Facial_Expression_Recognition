# Facial Epression Recognition Project

This project is a first dive into CNN's and their applications in learning image data. The project was inspired by current facial recognition software. A kaggle competition from 2013 was found that matched the intentions of this project and was used as a baseline to see how the models created in this notebook performed at this facial epxression recognition task.

Note that the data has not been added to this repo, to retireve the data please download the "icml_face_data.csv" file from the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge
